The purpose of this project was to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. We then created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
